# Guild-Website
Website template for displaying information about your WoW guild.

## How to Use
If you are new to the site hit Create New. This will bring you to the page where you can add your guilds name, region and realm, and info about how cool you are. Currently you must refresh the page after creating, for the guild to show up on the site. In the nav bar, there is a drop down to select a guild from the created guilds. Once a guild is selected, all of the information on the site will be updated to that guilds information.

## Technologies Used
We used React for the front-end, while using Sinatra and Ruby to set up the back-end. We used postgres to create a sql database.
